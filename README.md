# Capstone-3-Instacart_market_basket_analysis

Develop a machine learning model to predict the future behaviour or buying pattern of customers using Instacart data of 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 users.

The Instacart data include orders of 200,000 Instacart users with each user having between 4 and 100 orders. Instacart indicates each order in the data as prior, train or test. 
Prior orders describe the past behaviour of a user while train and test orders regard the future behaviour that we need to predict. We want to predict which previously purchased products i.e. prior orders will be in a userâ€™s next order (train and test orders). The setting of the Instacart problem is described in the figure below.
